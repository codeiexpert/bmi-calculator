        - People who have BMI equal or over 27.5 are classified as having obesity, which is defined as an abnormal or excessive accumulation of fat that may harm health. It is recommended that you consult a healthcare professional trained in obesity management for diagnosis, risk assessment and treatment of obesity and weight-related health complications. The goal of managing and treating obesity is not simply to lose weight and keep it off, but instead to improve health and lower the risks of other health complications. Losing even a modest amount of weight, such as five percent of body weight or more, and maintaining this weight loss, can improve overall wellbeing, while also reducing the risk of weight-related complications.
